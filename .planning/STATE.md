# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-27)

**Core value:** A reader clones the repo, runs `docker compose up`, and immediately sees the real wire-size and latency difference between classical and post-quantum ratchet protocols in a working chat.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation + Classical Session

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation + Classical Session)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-27 — Roadmap created (6 phases, 25 requirements mapped)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: crypto/mlkem for PQ KEM (no CGo, Go stdlib, hermetic build)
- Init: in-band key exchange — Bob publishes prekey bundle as first channel message
- Init: Prometheus labels (protocol, role) attached at scrape level, not emitted by binaries

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 risk: `scka.Provider.Snapshot()` deep-copy correctness has no authoritative reference beyond MockSCKA — integration test required
- Phase 2 risk: `TripleRatchetMessage` serialization format not specified by library — project must define canonical encoding (JSON with all fields including SCKAHeader)
- Phase 5 risk: Grafana provisioning behavior should be validated against a running compose before committing dashboard JSON

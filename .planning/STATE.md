# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-27)

**Core value:** A reader clones the repo, runs `docker compose up`, and immediately sees the real wire-size and latency difference between classical and post-quantum ratchet protocols in a working chat.
**Current focus:** Phase --phase — 01

## Current Position

Phase: --phase (01) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of --name
Status: Executing Phase --phase
Last activity: 2026-04-27 -- Phase --phase execution started

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 25%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: crypto/mlkem for PQ KEM (no CGo, Go stdlib, hermetic build)
- Init: in-band key exchange — Bob publishes prekey bundle as first channel message
- Init: Prometheus labels (protocol, role) attached at scrape level, not emitted by binaries
- [Phase 01]: Go 1.25.0 minimum (auto-bumped by go mod tidy due to go-doubleratchet requiring Go 1.25) — Toolchain enforces higher minimum
- [Phase 01]: Created internal/deps/deps.go with blank imports for dependency tracking — go mod tidy strips unused requires; blank imports preserve them

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 risk: `scka.Provider.Snapshot()` deep-copy correctness has no authoritative reference beyond MockSCKA — integration test required
- Phase 2 risk: `TripleRatchetMessage` serialization format not specified by library — project must define canonical encoding (JSON with all fields including SCKAHeader)
- Phase 5 risk: Grafana provisioning behavior should be validated against a running compose before committing dashboard JSON
